**After 6 months of flawless operation this app has suddenly stopped working because of an issue with Heroku and I have not had time to investigate as of yet.
I've yet to confirm but I suspect the issue is this:**

Heroku has emliminated their free student hosting program. All of my apps deployed to Heroku stopped working at the same time.
I apologize to any potential employer who wanted to see the live program, but if you look at the code you'll see it's written properly and efficiently.
